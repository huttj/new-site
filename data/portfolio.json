The goal was to incorporate multiple SharePoint services--the list, message board, and more--into a single, cohesive interface that would be easy to search and browse. <br/>To expand on the usability and discoverability of the items in the library, I added 'tags' in a later revision. This allows us to define a tag list and hierarchy, and then tag any item in the library with the appropriate tags. Users can browse the library using the tags, either by drilling down in the hierarchy, or by moving laterally to related tags.",

Despite the fact that site was created in an antiquated version of [Microsoft Publisher](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3879956/how-was-this-website-made-whats-frontpage-5-0), I managed to update the relevant parts. After creating my own site and the site for Real Sort, I decided to try making a simple PHP-based site from scratch. I couldn't use a CMS like WordPress or [GetSimple](http://get-simple.info/) because the university's webserver did not offer database access, and its PHP installation was several versions out of date. <br/>So, I wrote a basic framework of my own with PHP, using the what I learned modifying WordPress installations and themes. To make it simple to update and maintain, I used a file reading script to parse plain text files and output the pages of the site. I did this for the whole site, including the “Publications” section, which has special code to specify the type of colored marker that appears for each entry. The student section has optional entries for email, resume, and homepage, and the links section looks for delineations of different categories within the text file. <br/>(Note: The lab now has a new webmaster, who has [updated the site](http://www.ee.washington.edu/research/seal/index.html). So far, I like the look of it.)",

I spoke with one of their recruiters, who mentioned that it would be helpful if I could redesign their front page. So, I began to put something together, using the Twitter Bootstrap framework, only to realize that I would be fighting it a lot of the way. So, I scrapped that, and started to put together something from scratch. What I accomplished is what you see above. The proudest part, for me, is the globe at the bottom, which was a little bit of a challenge to engineer. I used the Sticky plugin to do it, but I actually had to figure out the code to make the DIV stick to the bottom. It was really exciting when I got it. For this page, I’d like to make it tighter and more “shiny,” like theirs, but I’m not sure how much more time I want to put into it. (Note: Since it was just a mock-up, I worked exclusively in Chrome. I may return to it in the future to make it work in other browsers.)",

We chose the [Adapt theme](http://www.wpexplorer.com/adapt-free-responsive-wordpress-theme), by AJ Clarke. <br/>I did an extensive amount of customization to get the look just right. I learned some PHP while fixing the page titles and page templates, and I worked out how to make an expanding menu in pure CSS. I also handled all of the domain and hosting management, as well as the email and script configuration. And, of course, what I am most proud of is that I maintained the adaptive quality of the site. It was a wonderful experience, despite being grueling at times. If I were to do it over, I would probably manage the code a little better, though I’m planning a few rewrites for the near future.",
