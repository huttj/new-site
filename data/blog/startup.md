I am a student of business, eagerly learning on my own accord. I spend much of my free time reading, studying, and pondering the principles, tricks, tips, and techniques espoused by many different people in from a variety of stations. My current favorites include [Ramit Sethi], the folks at [CopyBlogger], and many other folks who take the time to share their experience and expertise on [reddit] and [Quora].

As a bi-product of my ever-growing interest in business and entrepreneurship, I am quick to share what I have learned with friends, family, and co-workers. Lately, I have been working to help a coworker develop his own fledgling business into a smoothly-running, well-oiled, income-generating machine. To date, he has graciously listened to my advice and insight, and I have enjoyed working with him and helping him to analyze and review his business model and approach.

Just last week, we made excellent progress in revising his business plan, and I am delighted by the progress we made. The key change we made was to simplify the approach and offering, and to narrow the focus to a specific segment of his chosen market.

By emphasizing a single offering, we are able to design a compelling product with a clear call to action that resonates with customers from his target market. This is the correct way to start: simply and practically, without trying to be all things to all potential customers. Expansion and growth will come in time, after we have established the business and validated the model. For now, starting with something manageable and getting customers (and, more importantly, customer feedback) is the goal.

Today, I came across an question on Quora that reminded me of this experience, and I tried to condense what I have learned so far into a short answer of practical advice&mdash;the kind that would have helped me when I was the asker's age.

>Remember that you do not have to build something amazing, or revolutionary. Not at all. On the contrary, the best ideas to start with are those limited in scope, with a the right mix of practicality and indespensibility.
>
>You do not have to solve every problem. You just have to solve one problem, in a way that at least one person will want to pay for.
>
>Aim small and certain. Hit that easy bullseye until you are comfortable, then dream big.

I hope it can be as useful to someone as the other content on Quora has been for me.
