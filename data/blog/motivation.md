I stumbled onto [a reddit post](http://bit.ly/O5Mx1k) asking for advice about motivation. There is a lot of good advice in the thread, most of which I have seen before, in one form or another. Like many, I have struggled with the issue of motivation. When I began college, I was extremely motivated, and I remained so well into my second year. However, I was severely lacking in discipline, which led to many results that were below my (perhaps unrealistically high) standards. Consequentially, I blamed my poor performance on my motivation, thinking that I was too zealous, and that I could achieve more by simply dialing it back. That was wrong, and the result was that I became chronically unmotivated. I was still able to accomplish my goals, but they were much fewer in number, and I have not really excelled as much as I would like, in the past year or so.

Anyway, now I know that the answer to my discipline problem is actually quite simple. It is especially easy to resolve when motivation is not an issue, so I recommend dealing with that first. Essentially, discipline is a result of training, by using a regimented approach and training ourselves to channel our motivation into focused, successful strategies that will maximize the results.

One of the top comments was a great example of one such strategy: a firm, regimented approach that I have taken in the past, which generally works quite well (although not if you have issues with motivation):

> 1. Make lists. My father used to say, “when I wake up in the morning, I make a mental list of the THREE THINGS I have to do today. Usually I end up doing more, but I start with those three things.” A list gives you a concrete, definable set of tasks that need to be done and a starting and ending point.
>
> 2. Subdivide tasks into manageable pieces. “Clean the apartment” is a nice task in the abstract, but it’s both daunting and nebulous. Instead, parse it into: put all clothes into the hamper, vacuum the floor, wash the dishes, dust the bookshelf, do the laundry, etc. Many people find doing small tasks much easier to do than a small list of very large and lengthy tasks. It also lets you start and stop if you get tired or bored.

> 3. If you’re really lazy, you might have to create your own reward system. After you finish a chore, you get to do something else you’d rather do. You get to go on one raid AFTER the clothes are in the washer. Then, play a game, and put the clothes in the dryer. Watch an episode of your favorite television show. Fold the clothes and put them away. Surf the ‘net for half an hour. Wash the dishes, then you play another game.

> 4. Get a timer. You’re not allowed to do anything for more than an hour, whether it’s productive or not. If you’ve been doing homework for an hour, it’s time to take a break so you don’t burn out. Go check out Reddit, but set the timer again. You don’t get to surf Reddit for more than hour, either. After that’s done, you get back to work.

>5. Take a step back from your situation and ask yourself, “if I didn’t live here, what would I think of this place?” It’s easy to think that it’s your place, you’re the only one who lives there, no one else sees it, so who cares if there’s a pair of underwear on the lamp that’s been there for two weeks. If it helps, imagine that you have a lady friend coming. Would she be impressed or would she run away in terror? If it’s the latter, then your place is awful, and you’re never going to have company at your place if you don’t fix it.

I like that approach because it is exact, which makes it somewhat scientific. If you do it, you will be successful without fail, and it is even good at defeating a lot of the more common challenges to motivation that we experience. However, even though it is a successful strategy for achieving discipline, it is also prone to failure if used primarily to motivate. None of the steps are particularly difficult, of course, but they are easily abandoned, especially because they seem “external,” as if a productivity framework designed with a one-size-fits-all mentality was simply superimposed on top of one’s existing approach (complete with a lack of motivation). It works for a while, but it feels uncomfortable or unsustainable if you lack a strong [motivation foundation](javascript:void(0) Haha! "That rhymes.").

I believe that the best foundation is strong belief. One of the easiest and most effective things one can do in terms of getting motivated is altering their belief structure. The key belief that changes everything is concerned with the individual.

**You have to believe that you are capable – that you are effective and can accomplish what you set your mind to.**

My response to the original poster was as follows:

>Hi,

>I left a comment on your post, but I’m not sure if you’re going to get the chance to read it.
>
>I just wanted to say that I believe you have to value yourself, and believe that you have the power and the sensibility to accomplish anything that you desire.
>
>When you truly accept that, you will be able to think of any goal you want, and instantly pursue it.
>
>There won’t be any struggle, or debates with yourself over the merits of the goal — you’ll simply be able to go to work, like a machine, with the sole purpose of making your goal a reality.
>
>But you really have to believe in yourself. Believe that you are a capable, intelligent, and effective human being. Not that you “could be, if you only wanted to, or had a good reason.” No, just that you are, at your very essence.
>
>Once you truly believe that, the only reason you’ll need for a goal is that you picked it. :)
>
>Good luck, and let me know if this helps.

>P.S. You might want to check out Tony Robbins’ work. What I wrote is inspired by his guide to personal change, which is founded on three beliefs: (1) Something must change. (2) I must change it. (3) I can change it.

>Again, good luck, and believe in yourself!
