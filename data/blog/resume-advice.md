One of the core missions of [Seattle JS Hackers](https://goo.gl/uxcwWa), the meetup group that I help organize, is to
help developers find jobs. There are several aspects to this, for which I have offered [a few resources on our repo](https://goo.gl/C25XJQ).

The first step is getting an interview, which is made a lot easier when you have an effective resume. Another benefit
of focusing on making your resume more effective is that it feeds directly into your interview preparation â€“ everything
on your resume is (or, should be, at least) a potential discussion point in an interview, and each detail should invite
the interviewer to ask questions for which you have compelling answers. It is critically important.

With that background, here are my resume tips.


### Prerequisites

Before you set about working on your resume, you need to have something to put *on* your resume. While it may be
tempting to pad out your GitHub profile with lots of little projects, like Tic-Tac-Toe, a Pomodoro Timer, and the like,
that's not really the best way to go.

What most companies are looking for is *depth*. They want to see that you've put time, energy, and thought into a
single project, and that you've developed complex features that have some business value. This means it's much better to
have a single, flagship project in your portfolio that you can demonstrate and talk about.

When I went into my first developer interview, I brought [Cerca](http://getcerca.com). I brought it out on my phone and
showed how it worked, while talking about the features and technical implementation (realtime updates with WebSockets,
cross-platform with the hybrid Ionic Framework, SMS integration with Twilio). Having such a complete and detailed
project made my case for me, and I think it was what got me the job.

To summarize: **Pick a single portfolio project to develop in depth and take all the way to publishing** (i.e., put it
on the app store, or on the web).

Also, before you go on, read [Ramit Sethi's blog post](https://goo.gl/QunUzc) on this topic. You may prefer to [watch
his video](https://goo.gl/UpX7S4), instead. Ramit is very knowledgeable on this topic, and a lot of what I've learned
came from him.


### Revising your resume

Extending what Ramit advises ("Every word needs to earn its way onto the page"), I propose that each bullet point on 
your resume needs to provide detail about at least one of three distinct aspects of your work:
 
1. **What was uniquely challenging about what you did**, either from a technical perspective or logistical one, and how
did you surmount that challenge?

2. **What was the business value of what you did?** Can you attach a dollar figure to it? Maybe you helped the company
earn more money, or maybe you helped them save money. If there's no dollar figure, can you describe how what you did
improved things for the customer?

3. **What was unique or unusual about what you did?** Anything that makes it memorable or otherwise interesting.

Go back through your resume and examine every single bullet point to make sure they highlight at least one of these
things. If you find a point that does not, try to modify it so that it does. If you can't, remove it.


### Why this is important

Your resume is often the first thing that an hiring manager sees. What's more, if you read [Ramit's post](https://goo.gl/QunUzc)
(go back and read it if you didn't), you now know that a hiring manager only spends *seconds* (even as few as ten)
skimming your resume before deciding whether to trash it or to call you. That's not a lot of time, which means you have to
make your resume as interesting and eye-catching as possible. Everything the hiring manager sees should catch their eye,
and make them think, "Huh, I want to hear more about that."

If you're writing sterile observations about what you did that look like they could've been pulled from a job
description, *you've already lost.* You need to be writing lines with the same catchyness as titles from books and
newspaper articles.

The other part of this is that, like article titles, you are going to back up what you put on your resume with a story.
When your interviewer calls you up and asks you about what you did at your last job, they probably have your resume
right in front of them. This is your chance to paint a great picture of what you wrote with an interesting,
well-organized narrative that justifies the hook (the angle(s) that you used from above), and concisely communicates
your knowledge and understanding.

Every bullet point on your resume is a jumping-off point for an interesting story that demonstrates your value. It's a
topic for another post, but your resume is critical for setting that stage and preparing the interviewer for what
they're going to hear when they get you on the phone.

Good luck, and if you have any questions, leave a comment and let me know!
