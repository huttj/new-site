Call me naive, but I believe everything always works out beautifully, even if it wasn't how we would have designed it if we were in charge. We can never see the whole picture. But, as we watch our corner of the tapestry unfurl, we might see things we don't like, some colors that we actually enjoy may give way to colors that we don't. Patterns may emerge that challenge our senses.

Given enough time and distance, however, we can look back on the revealed parts and see a beautiful story. Good things end, and give way to greater things. Or rather, good things end, and greater things await, if we only open our hearts and our minds to receive them.

Sometimes, our minds and hearts are so closed, running on autopilot, that a bad thing has to happen, to wake up with a start. We can lament the bad thing, and surely it deserves to be lamented, but we would do well to thank the bad thing for the reminder to live more fully, before we eventually die.

I remember such a time. I took my kayak out on the Puget Sound. I brought my camera, in my dry bag. I used it to snap a few nice photos of the Tacoma Narrows bridge, and returned it to the bag, without dropping it in the water. When I returned to the shore, I picked up my kayak, and my bag, attached to the kayak with a loose strap, fell to the rocky sand, with a frighteningly dull thud.

"Shit," I thought. "My cameraâ€¦" I returned to the car and lamented my luck, lugging the kayak up the hill and around the bend, to my car. Checking my camera, I found it unharmed.
"What luck," I remarked. "I'm glad it fell on the beach, and not the cement!"

Many things in life are like that. A bad thing that alerts us to a worse possibility. Maybe we break a bone, but save our life. Maybe we miss out on a trip, but get a wake up call. Anything that doesn't kill us brings us closer to the core of life. A core that is so easy to miss. Ironic, that in living life, we naturally grow numb to the beautiful essence. Being alive, truly alive, is a special state that requires constant vigilance to protect. Or, if we do not, constant suffering to remind us that we're missing something.
