So today, while browsing the ever-popular link portal reddit, I came across a picture on the front page of [/r/food](http://www.reddit.com/r/food) with the title, *Home-cooked Chicken Tikka Bhuna*. Now, until today, I had never made any Indian recipes (or even any of the semi-traditional Persian foods I used to enjoy at home). However, after glancing at the recipe and remembering how delicious a friend's homemade Chicken Tikka Pizza was, I decided that I had to give it a try. I went to Safeway with a coworker to do some team shopping.

They had nearly everything I needed at Safeway, except for garam masala, curry leaves, and, apparently, ground corriander. Thankfully, I remembered [a small store](http://www.yelp.com/biz/r-and-m-grocery-and-video-seattle) a way up the road, from which I had purchased a few similar items for my mother sometime last year. I went there and purchased the items, in Ziploc bags, for considerably cheaper than any of the spices I had purchased from Safeway. The bags contain probably the same amount you would find in [a large spice container](javascript: "such as the plastic McCormick ones") and they were only about $1.50 each. Quite a good deal. I will have to check next time to see if they have the spices that I buy more regularly. I am betting they do.

Anyway, I jumped headfirst into the recipe, and I have to say that I feel like it went pretty well. I did not have nearly enough time to marinate the meat, but the Tikka sauce was fragrant enough to flavor it quite strongly, regardless. As for the Bhuna part--that went fairly well, too. There was also a lot of onion to begin with, but it was quite balanced out in the end, by the chicken. I would say that if I had it to do again, I would probably add just a little bit less cinnamon, and perhaps I would be more generous with some of the other spices. In particular, I would probably favor the cumin a bit more, as it smells delicious and really is my favorite spice. In my house, we put it on pizza, sandwiches, and pretty much anything else that needs a little bit of an extra kick. I would probably add a little bit of curry powder to the recipe, as well.

Without further ado, here are some pictures that I captured, of my own helping of Chicken Tikka Bhuna. They're not the best quality, as they were taken with my [phone](javascript: "Alas, the Galaxy Nexus no Lumina 920."), but they've been treated with some pretty nice filters, courtesy of [Camera 360 for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=vStudio.Android.Camera360).

Reddit user pdaddyo shared the recipe in the comment section of the post:

> ### Recipe:
>
> Tikka style marinade:
>
> * about 100ml of low fat natural yogurt (would probably use even less next time)
> * 1 tsp garam masala
> * 1 tsp ground cumin
> * 1 tsp ground cinnamon
> * 1 tsp ground cayenne pepper -- obviously tweak for heat (this was a medium curry i'd say)
> * 2 tsp of paprika (this was mainly for colour)
> * 2-3cm fresh grated ginger
> * loads of freshly milled black pepper
> * juice of small lemon
> * juice of half a lime
> * pinch of salt
>
> Mix all that in a big bowl, and add even-sized chunks of chicken (EDIT: 3 chicken breast used), cover and leave in fridge for as long as poss (I did 3 hours, a day+ would be amazing!)
> Then I skewered the chunks, discarded the marinade and grilled on absolute max temp for about 5 mins each side (until charring just a little mmmm)
> OK that's the tikka mmmmm!
>
> Then to make a garlicy onion Bhuna vibe I took:
> 
> * 3 cloves garlic crushed
> * 2 fresh chillis (I deseeded) finely diced
> * 1 knob of butter, guessing 10g? (needs to absorb spices)
> * Heated butter, softened garlic + chilli for 1 minute then added
> 
> * 1 tsp garam masala
> * 1 tsp ground coriander
> * 1 tsp ground cumin
> * few curry leaves
>
> Cooked the spices for about 1-2 mins, then added:
> 
> 4 small onions, diced and sliced various ways
> Cooked gently for about 5 minutes, then added the chicken and loads of fresh coriander
> I then added a splash or two of water cos it was looking very dry, and had it on super-low heat covered up for about 5 minutes to kind of steam + reheat the chicken mmmmmmm!
> Bit more fresh coriander (cilantro in US) before serving with basmati rice.
> That's it kids!
